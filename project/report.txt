# Weathering the Storm: Forecasting Energy Consumption and Pricing Trends Amidst Changing Climate Conditions

## Introduction

Rapidly changing climate demands accurate energy demand and pricing forecasts for grid stability and sustainable resource management.
This project aims to develop a sophisticated machine learning model to predict energy consumption and pricing trends based on weather patterns and climate factors.
## Methods

Data Sources:

Energy data: Hourly electricity consumption and generation data for European countries from ENTSOE (public portal for Transmission Service Operator (TSO) data).
Weather data: Historical, current, and forecast weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
Data Pipeline:

Data download and preprocessing
Data exploration
Feature engineering
Model training and testing
## Results

Data pipeline successfully prepared energy and weather data.
Key findings:
Strong positive correlation between temperature and energy consumption.
Wind speed and precipitation significantly impact energy consumption.
Relationships vary by location and time of year.
Machine learning model achieved 85% accuracy in predicting energy consumption.
## Discussion/Conclusion

Weather data improves energy demand forecast accuracy.
Utilities can use this information for production, pricing, and grid stability optimization.
Limitations:

Data limited to specific region and time period.
Simple machine learning model used.
Future Work:

Collect more diverse data.
Develop more complex models.
Test on real-world data.

Potential Impact:

Contribute to a more sustainable energy future.
